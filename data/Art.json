There's nothing to it.\n\nCan the OP do stuff conceptually as near flawless as this? This answer is no. He's 'alright'. All you need to do is look him up on YouTube and compare the drawings they do of existing pictures, to the more conceptual ones. (The Harley Quinn, the predator vs alien) and you'll see that they don't hold up. What does this mean? It means while the OP is great at drawing existing pictures or still life, they are lacking in creative skills like coming up with their own composition, drawing elements from memory. \n\nI'm critical of this because I know how easy it is to ride this kind of stuff, I've done it myself and people who are not so artistically trained will be fooled, which is the majority of people. To improve as an artist, especially one that specialises in drawing people, you need to study anatomy and composition. I'm doing it myself, and while I stay away from realism I found that it has vastly  improved my artwork. OP has a knack for art, I think it's daft to waste it on boring stuff like this.\n\nDown vote me into the ground if you want.

He tied the goat to one of the tent pegs, watching as it withdrew itself fearfully under a nearby outcrop of rock. \u0026amp;quot;I hope you don\u0026amp;#39;t know something that I don\u0026amp;#39;t\u0026amp;quot; he said, sighing at the bad omen and climbing into his tent.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thunder rumbled through the sky, waking him from his deep sleep. He heard it again and then once more, but no flash accompanied them. Pulling himself out of his tent he spotted something that made his heart pause in his chest. Three large beings were making their way trough the bottom of the valley. Not quite as large as the titan but not far off. He watched as, laughing, they each tried to draw the sword from the titan\u0026amp;#39;s chest. Failing, they started kicking stones the size of hills back and forth along the valley floor. One noticed the tent and goat along side the narrow valley path and he had no choice but to dive into the snow as a hand ten times his size grasped for it. He watched, buried in snow as the beasts tore the limbs from his goat and chuckled happily in blood lust. He knew that they wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t see him in the snow, but he also knew now why these paths should not be travelled.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_5tdt8h","ParentID":"t3_5tdt8h","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_ddmakln","UpVotes":9,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1486835342,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"fluffykin5","Body":"Forced perspective is cool!

The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.

Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.

If you take all of these cool drug like me then maybe you’ll arrive at the same artistic conclusions, but thankfully nobody else has ever been reckless enough to try.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;-Felix Colgrave, professional animator.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_65l854","ParentID":"t1_dgbha61","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dgbjamh","UpVotes":89,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1492308871,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"MisterBigStuff","Body":"lol drugs amirite?","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;lol drugs amirite?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_65l854","ParentID":"t1_dgbha61","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dgbin76","UpVotes":31,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1492307909,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"owenreddit2016","Body":"rogte","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;rogte\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_65l854","ParentID":"t1_dgbin76","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dgbj2io","UpVotes":2,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1492308536,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]},{"Author":"Nathpowe","Body":"Here's his full works http://www.paragonfineart.com/artists/rob-gonsalves.html","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0026amp;#39;s his full works \u0026lt;a href=\"http://www.paragonfineart.com/artists/rob-gonsalves.html\"\u0026gt;http://www.paragonfineart.com/artists/rob-gonsalves.html\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_65l854","ParentID":"t1_dgbha61","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dgbjcau","UpVotes":21,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1492308936,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"MAADcitykid","Body":"Damn pricy","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Damn pricy\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_65l854","ParentID":"t1_dgbjcau","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dgbkphu","UpVotes":14,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1492310955,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"mces97","Body":"My aunt has a couple of pictures from an amazing artist in her house.

When your ability fails you, you return to that library and start expanding it, trying new things and drawing knowledge and inspiration from others on that same journey. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;All that\u0026amp;#39;s required of you to get started is as much time as you\u0026amp;#39;re comfortably willing to dedicate towards it. An hour before bed, minutes here and there. As long as you have \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;some\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; forward momentum, you\u0026amp;#39;ll make progress. Eventually you\u0026amp;#39;ll come across the things that make you \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;want\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; to dedicate a whole afternoon to something, maybe even a few days. It won\u0026amp;#39;t even be work anymore, just want you want to do.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_5j6a91","ParentID":"t1_dbdvwx3","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dbdxsiu","UpVotes":9,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1482168460,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]}]},{"Author":"Cheesemacher","Body":"Yeah, Jakub Rozalski didn't come out the pussy drawing fucking Mozart","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yeah, Jakub Rozalski didn\u0026amp;#39;t come out the pussy drawing fucking Mozart\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_5j6a91","ParentID":"t1_dbdt5iu","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dbdxt75","UpVotes":15,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1482168482,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]},{"Author":"NightHawk521","Body":"I think those are from the Scythe boardgame?

Americans care, first and foremost, about themselves and their families.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Whatever this man is getting ready to fight against, he\u0026amp;#39;s not fighting to defend his country.  He\u0026amp;#39;s not fighting for the Constitution, or for \u0026amp;quot;freedom.\u0026amp;quot; He\u0026amp;#39;s fighting for his family.  For the people in the houses behind him.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The artist might be trying to paint this in a negative light, but to me, this painting has a huge amount of stark beauty to it.  Yes, Americans can be kind of raw and wild.  Yes, we can be somewhat unprofessional and brash.  And yes, we can kind of tend to think of ourselves as the center of the entire world.  But at the end of the day, every red-blooded American I know would gladly pick up his gun, walk outside, and stand, unafraid, facing whatever enemy came over that hill, to protect his family.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"Art","LinkID":"t3_5meutt","ParentID":"t1_dc3ekyf","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7a","FullID":"t1_dc3skv2","UpVotes":19,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1483759076,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"PrivateChicken","Body":"\u0026gt; aside from the Civil War\n\nAnd that revolution business.
