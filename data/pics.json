of your choice of VPN provider, it's important to stay safe on the internet. A VPN is not the only way you can keep your privacy in check. However, if a VPN interests you, you can see choices, pros and cons, and more at [this handy website](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-section/). A few other things:\n\nFirstly, consider donating to the [EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate) or [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/donate-aclu?ms=web_horiz_nav_hp\u0026amp;redirect=donate/join-renew-give) ( Charity nav links for [EFF](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary\u0026amp;orgid=7576) and [ACLU](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary\u0026amp;orgid=3247) )\n\nSecondly, [Take some time to read privacytools.io](https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/) - A lot of good information there about privacy in our digital age as well as links to reputable VPNs, search engines, and softwares that all take your privacy seriously.\n\nLastly, because this always comes up, here is an excerpt from the /r/privacy FAQ\n\n---\n\nWhy do I care about privacy if I don't have anything to hide?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you wear clothes, use passwords, close doors, use envelopes, or sometimes speak softly, then you *do* have something to hide; you're just having trouble understanding that *you already do care about privacy*.  Here are some references to help you understand why everyone, *especially honest hard-working people*, needs privacy.\n\n* [TechRepublic - Why 'Nothing to Hide' misrepresents online privacy](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/why-nothing-to-hide-misrepresents-online-privacy/) - A legal research professor explains to Michael P.

But if you look more closely, you’ll see this idea is full of holes.\n* [Wired.com - Why 'I Have Nothing to Hide' Is the Wrong Way to Think About Surveillance](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/why-i-have-nothing-to-hide-is-the-wrong-way-to-think-about-surveillance/) - \n* [ZDNet - Privacy is innately flawed: 'Nothing to hide' does not exist](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/privacy-is-innately-flawed-nothing-to-hide-does-not-exist/9577) - There is no such thing as \"I have nothing to hide\".

It's been debunked countless times in the past, but with the line being trotted out frequently in response to the NSA revelations, it's time for yet another debunking, and there are two good ones that were recently published.\n* [WashingtonExaminer - Even law-abiding people should oppose surveillance](http://washingtonexaminer.com/tim-carney-even-law-abiding-people-should-oppose-surveillance/article/2531452) - In other words, why should law-abiding citizens mind federal surveillance?\n* [The Chronicle - Why Privacy Matters Even if You Have 'Nothing to Hide'](https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/) - A long and thorough article on many, many different reasons why the NTHNTF argument is basically invalid.\n* [Mail Online - If we have nothing to hide, then why should we have to prove it?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2339142/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-If-hide-prove-it.html) - Those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear.

The statement that only those with something to hide will have something to fear, is nothing more than a thoughtless and foolish mantra repeated by those who prefer platitudes to the demands of careful and rational thinking.\n* Watch [this snippet but the whole talk is informative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM7HQ_zbdIw#t=8m00s).\n* Read [this](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html) and [this](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/?viewMobile=0) for explanations of why you should care.\n* Visit [this](http://donttrack.us/) and [this](http://dontbubble.us/) website for different side of privacy on the web and its importance.\n* In depth article about advertiser tracking at [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/im-being-followed-how-google-and-104-other-companies-are-tracking-me-on-the-web/253758/) and when all this data is combined at [CIO](http://www.cio.com/article/print/706457).\n* Watch this video on [why Privacy matters](https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/why-privacy-matters)\n* This non-technical explanation of [why privacy matters](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/) uses literary references.","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Regardless of your choice of VPN provider, it\u0026amp;#39;s important to stay safe on the internet.

The Democrats are much better when it comes to trying to protect the public interest.

Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America’s long-term fiscal problems.\n\n2. Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs.\n\n3. Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide “living wills” to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers’ money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies.\n\n4. Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country. Last troops left on December 18, 2011.\n\n5. Began Drawdown of War in Afghanistan: From a peak of 101,000 troops in June 2011, U.S. forces are now down to 91,000, with 23,000 slated to leave by the end of summer 2012. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, the combat mission there will be over by next year.\n\n6. Eliminated Osama bin laden: In 2011, ordered special forces raid of secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which the terrorist leader was killed and a trove of al-Qaeda documents was discovered.\n\n7. Turned Around U.S. Auto Industry: In 2009, injected $62 billion in federal money (on top of $13.4 billion in loans from the Bush administration) into ailing GM and Chrysler in return for equity stakes and agreements for massive restructuring. Since bottoming out in 2009, the auto industry has added more than 100,000 jobs. In 2011, the Big Three automakers all gained market share for the first time in two decades. The government expects to lose $16 billion of its investment, less if the price of the GM stock it still owns increases.\n\n8. Recapitalized Banks: In the midst of financial crisis, approved controversial Treasury Department plan to lure private capital into the country’s largest banks via “stress tests” of their balance sheets and a public-private fund to buy their “toxic” assets. Got banks back on their feet at essentially zero cost to the government.\n\n9. Repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Ended 1990s-era restriction and formalized new policy allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military for the first time.\n\n10. Toppled Moammar Gaddafi: In March 2011, joined a coalition of European and Arab governments in military action, including air power and naval blockade, against Gaddafi regime to defend Libyan civilians and support rebel troops. Gaddafi’s forty-two-year rule ended when the dictator was overthrown and killed by rebels on October 20, 2011. No American lives were lost.\n\n11. Told Mubarak to Go: On February 1, 2011, publicly called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to accept reform or step down, thus weakening the dictator’s position and putting America on the right side of the Arab Spring. Mubarak ended thirty-year rule when overthrown on February 11.\n\n12. Reversed Bush Torture Policies: Two days after taking office, nullified Bush-era rulings that had allowed detainees in U.S. custody to undergo certain “enhanced” interrogation techniques considered inhumane under the Geneva Conventions. Also released the secret Bush legal rulings supporting the use of these techniques.\n\n13. Improved America’s Image Abroad: With new policies, diplomacy, and rhetoric, reversed a sharp decline in world opinion toward the U.S. (and the corresponding loss of “soft power”) during the Bush years. From 2008 to 2011, favorable opinion toward the United States rose in ten of fifteen countries surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, with an average increase of 26 percent.\n\n14. Kicked Banks Out of Federal Student Loan Program, Expanded Pell Grant Spending: As part of the 2010 health care reform bill, signed measure ending the wasteful decades-old practice of subsidizing banks to provide college loans. Starting July 2010 all students began getting their federal student loans directly from the federal government. Treasury will save $67 billion over ten years, $36 billion of which will go to expanding Pell Grants to lower-income students.\n\n15. Created Race to the Top: With funds from stimulus, started $4.35 billion program of competitive grants to encourage and reward states for education reform.\n\n16. Boosted Fuel Efficiency Standards: Released new fuel efficiency standards in 2011 that will nearly double the fuel economy for cars and trucks by 2025.\n\n17. Coordinated International Response to Financial Crisis: To keep world economy out of recession in 2009 and 2010, helped secure from G-20 nations more than $500 billion for the IMF to provide lines of credit and other support to emerging market countries, which kept them liquid and avoided crises with their currencies.\n\n18. Passed Mini Stimuli: To help families hurt by the recession and spur the economy as stimulus spending declined, signed series of measures (July 22, 2010; December 17, 2010; December 23, 2011) to extend unemployment insurance and cut payroll taxes.\n\n19. Began Asia “Pivot”: In 2011, reoriented American military and diplomatic priorities and focus from the Middle East and Europe to the Asian-Pacific region. Executed multipronged strategy of positively engaging China while reasserting U.S. leadership in the region by increasing American military presence and crafting new commercial, diplomatic, and military alliances with neighboring countries made uncomfortable by recent Chinese behavior.\n\n20. Increased Support for Veterans: With so many soldiers coming home from Iraq and Iran with serious physical and mental health problems, yet facing long waits for services, increased 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs budget by 16 percent and 2011 budget by 10 percent. Also signed new GI bill offering $78 billion in tuition assistance over a decade, and provided multiple tax credits to encourage businesses to hire veterans.\n\n21. Tightened Sanctions on Iran: In effort to deter Iran’s nuclear program, signed Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (2010) to punish firms and individuals who aid Iran’s petroleum sector. In late 2011 and early 2012, coordinated with other major Western powers to impose sanctions aimed at Iran’s banks and with Japan, South Korea, and China to shift their oil purchases away from Iran.\n\n22. Created Conditions to Begin Closing Dirtiest Power Plants: New EPA restrictions on mercury and toxic pollution, issued in December 2011, likely to lead to the closing of between sixty-eight and 231 of the nation’s oldest and dirtiest coal-fired power plants. Estimated cost to utilities: at least $11 billion by 2016. Estimated health benefits: $59 billion to $140 billion. Will also significantly reduce carbon emissions and, with other regulations, comprises what’s been called Obama’s “stealth climate policy.”\n\n23. Passed Credit Card Reforms: Signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (2009), which prohibits credit card companies from raising rates without advance notification, mandates a grace period on interest rate increases, and strictly limits overdraft and other fees.\n\n\n","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America’s long-term fiscal problems.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide “living wills” to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers’ money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country.

Just not done quite right. \n\n2. assassination, hunting the bounty hunter, the clone army, anakin and padme together (yuck, and maybe going back to naboo wasn't the right choice, why not in the City?), anakin's mother's death and first major darkness, and the fucking AWESOME arena sequence and desert war. \n\n3. Anakin kills Dooku, Greivous is decent I guess, Anakin getting closer with the Emperor, Padme pregnant, Council asks Anakin to spy, the younglings, Order 66. The showdown.

Darth Maul and Dooku should be the bad guys all the way thru and the Dark Lord behind them. And just small things throughout, sharpness type stuff. It's really just lazy writing. the issues are really very easily fixable with one or two more drafts and a grittier tone. \n\nI also think they missed a lot of opportunity on coruscant by staying in the senate buildings and jedi academy.

The policy she was fired over is going to be fought and in my interpretation of how the Constitution applies to our laws is unconstitutional. Therfore I think she got fired for doing the right thing; defending her oath to the Constitution before the promise to her boss.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Stop blowing up my inbox building this argument that I somehow must be unaware of the AG being a political appointment which means the president can hire and fire them.
