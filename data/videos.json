They are taking advantage of you because you are a small youtuber and you even said you probably wont do much about it apart from posting this to Reddit. With that mindset, whats to prevent this from happening again to you or someone else who actually enjoys film making? These hacks may deter future creators if they think people are out there stealing their ideas and getting triple the amount of views.

But these \u0026amp;#39;creators\u0026amp;#39; had blatant disregard for the days of work that went into the creative process for your video and are incredibly ignorant in their rationale for justifying why everything is \u0026amp;#39;gravy\u0026amp;#39; a la their \u0026amp;#39;inspired by\u0026amp;#39; note. These people are hacks and deserve to be exposed and their channel taken down. They are taking advantage of you because you are a small youtuber and you even said you probably wont do much about it apart from posting this to Reddit. With that mindset, whats to prevent this from happening again to you or someone else who actually enjoys film making? These hacks may deter future creators if they think people are out there stealing their ideas and getting triple the amount of views. I would explore your options with someone who knows a bit more about creative commons and digital plagiarism and force them to remove their video.

If you miss your arrival time by 2 hours or more because you were ***involuntarily*** bumped from your flight, the airline must 1) Refund you the full price of your airfare and 2) pay you up to a 400%!inconvenience fee up to a max of $1300 (whichever is lowest).\n\nSo that's your whole ticket cost(s) + 400%!up to $1,300.\n\nThat's Federal law. Never volunteer to get bumped. If they're going to bump you, they're going to bump you. At least get paid for it.\n\nAlso, this incident should be a real wake-up call to every American citizen. You have absolutely ZERO rights when you are on an airplane.

All the while the police are going to say the reason for the violence was something along the lines of \u0026amp;quot;to make sure the flight didn\u0026amp;#39;t get delayed too long.\u0026amp;quot; Because we have a video that shows he is not attacking them in any way they won\u0026amp;#39;t be able to make that claim. But at the end of the day the flight still left late because he then needed medical attention. So at the end of the day United\u0026amp;#39;s acts were not only selfish and made to cover their own incompetent acts, but they then have seemingly refused to actually apologize to the person they had beaten for no reason, and they have even released statements that sound an awful lot like they are blaming the Doctor because he didn\u0026amp;#39;t want to give up the seat. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64jl6s","ParentID":"t1_dg2lkwy","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg2qf6n","UpVotes":583,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491837535,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"needKnowledg3","Body":"Do you think we will ever live in a world where people refuse to beat on other humans for a paycheck.

However, none of the conditions listed there applies to this passenger, meaning that under the Contract of Carriage, United did not have the right to remove, forcibly or otherwise, this passenger. They basically fucked up by allowing people to board and once they did that, their only option for creating passenger space was to either find a passenger that violated one of the conditions under Rule 21, or increase the compensation until someone voluntarily chose to deplane. Sending in the police was not one of their options.\n\nUnited is probably shielded from the actions of the police unless that was a reasonably foreseeable consequence, and the police is themselves protected under sovereign immunity to some degree.

However, none of the conditions listed there applies to this passenger, meaning that under the Contract of Carriage, United did not have the right to remove, forcibly or otherwise, this passenger. They basically fucked up by allowing people to board and once they did that, their only option for creating passenger space was to either find a passenger that violated one of the conditions under Rule 21, or increase the compensation until someone voluntarily chose to deplane. Sending in the police was not one of their options.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;United is probably shielded from the actions of the police unless that was a reasonably foreseeable consequence, and the police is themselves protected under sovereign immunity to some degree. Various agencies and governmental sub-units waive the immunity to the degree they are insured as long as certain procedural conditions are met, but I cannot comment as to whether that would be the case here.

This really isn't any different than removing a drunk person from a bar, a disgruntled employee from an office, or a suspect from a retail store (all things I have done countless times while suspects have fought back).\n\nFirstly, any use of force must be **controlled.** You must be able to state the circumstance, describe the trained technique you're going to use, and the desired outcome with a fairly high level of detail. Grabbing someone by the hands and yanking them with all your weight is not controlled. You could get injured, they could get injured. There's no control. And I'm not privy to Chicago PD's training, but I'm fairly sure that isn't a trained technique nor is it the dynamic application of any I've ever heard of.\n\nThen, any injuries they have from your force is on you and the department. And the department will only cover your ass if you use something you've been trained on. This is far outside any department policy and I would expect to see disciplinary action on this. \n\nNow I get it: I wasn't there. I don't know what happened before, I don't know how long those officers talked to him. I can't even see if he fought back. But if policing is ever going to regain the public's trust we need to call out the bullshit when we see it. \n\nSo here's what I would do: \n\n1. Have a chat, let him know the airline is requesting him to leave. - probably happened.\n2. Now make it between me and him. I'm a Law Enforcement Officer giving you a lawful command, everything that's happened in the last 20 minutes is irrelevant right now, anything other than immediate compliance and you'll be arrested. - might have happened\n3. Hey partner, lets clear out everyone in the surrounding seats (you know, control the scene, policing 101). - did not happen\n4. Okay you're objection will be noted in my report, you are under arrest, I'm going to put handcuffs on you. - did not happen\nGenerally a person like this will comply when the cuffs are on. They'll hold them up to the camera, say a few words, and walk out peacefully. \n5. Sir, you're in cuffs, you're going to jail no matter what happens at this point. I will pick you up and carry you if need be, I don't want you to get hurt. If I get hurt you'll be charged with a felony. Please stop acting like a 5 year old. - did not happen\n6. Pain compliance, those cuffs will hurt real bad. Pressure points, etc. No real injury, just temporary pain. - did not happen\n7. He's already sitting so a simple behind the back carry while someone takes the legs will keep total weight on you under OSHA recommendations. - did not happen\n\nSure, 50 cameras pointed in your face doesn't make it easier.

This really isn\u0026amp;#39;t any different than removing a drunk person from a bar, a disgruntled employee from an office, or a suspect from a retail store (all things I have done countless times while suspects have fought back).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Firstly, any use of force must be \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;controlled.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; You must be able to state the circumstance, describe the trained technique you\u0026amp;#39;re going to use, and the desired outcome with a fairly high level of detail. Grabbing someone by the hands and yanking them with all your weight is not controlled. You could get injured, they could get injured. There\u0026amp;#39;s no control. And I\u0026amp;#39;m not privy to Chicago PD\u0026amp;#39;s training, but I\u0026amp;#39;m fairly sure that isn\u0026amp;#39;t a trained technique nor is it the dynamic application of any I\u0026amp;#39;ve ever heard of.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Then, any injuries they have from your force is on you and the department. And the department will only cover your ass if you use something you\u0026amp;#39;ve been trained on. This is far outside any department policy and I would expect to see disciplinary action on this. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now I get it: I wasn\u0026amp;#39;t there. I don\u0026amp;#39;t know what happened before, I don\u0026amp;#39;t know how long those officers talked to him. I can\u0026amp;#39;t even see if he fought back. But if policing is ever going to regain the public\u0026amp;#39;s trust we need to call out the bullshit when we see it. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So here\u0026amp;#39;s what I would do: \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Have a chat, let him know the airline is requesting him to leave. - probably happened.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Now make it between me and him. I\u0026amp;#39;m a Law Enforcement Officer giving you a lawful command, everything that\u0026amp;#39;s happened in the last 20 minutes is irrelevant right now, anything other than immediate compliance and you\u0026amp;#39;ll be arrested. - might have happened\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Hey partner, lets clear out everyone in the surrounding seats (you know, control the scene, policing 101). - did not happen\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Okay you\u0026amp;#39;re objection will be noted in my report, you are under arrest, I\u0026amp;#39;m going to put handcuffs on you. - did not happen\nGenerally a person like this will comply when the cuffs are on. They\u0026amp;#39;ll hold them up to the camera, say a few words, and walk out peacefully. \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Sir, you\u0026amp;#39;re in cuffs, you\u0026amp;#39;re going to jail no matter what happens at this point. I will pick you up and carry you if need be, I don\u0026amp;#39;t want you to get hurt. If I get hurt you\u0026amp;#39;ll be charged with a felony. Please stop acting like a 5 year old. - did not happen\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Pain compliance, those cuffs will hurt real bad. Pressure points, etc. No real injury, just temporary pain. - did not happen\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;He\u0026amp;#39;s already sitting so a simple behind the back carry while someone takes the legs will keep total weight on you under OSHA recommendations. - did not happen\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sure, 50 cameras pointed in your face doesn\u0026amp;#39;t make it easier. But it\u0026amp;#39;s 2017, if you haven\u0026amp;#39;t gotten on the news yet you better be prepared to. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64jl6s","ParentID":"t3_64jl6s","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg2mnc0","UpVotes":3414,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491833049,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"Moose_Joose","Body":"Found the good cop!

I am legally blind so i don\u0026amp;#39;t get out much and frequently used cabs to get to work and back home. Well when uber arrived in our city i used it for a while until i hired a private driver. I guess here\u0026amp;#39;s where the story begins. My driver was kinda shitty as a person and would dump his duties on to his seventy year old friend. Through this i found one of my best friends i could ever have. I\u0026amp;#39;m 27 years old and quite the loner but having the opportunity to listen to his crazy stories every day, even though I\u0026amp;#39;ve heard them thousands of times has been a blessing. Four years in this city and he is my only friend. I\u0026amp;#39;ll end it here because I\u0026amp;#39;m getting emotional. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_5ccvkk","ParentID":"t1_d9vmh9t","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_d9vobkl","UpVotes":239,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1478859344,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"thirdeyemermaid","Body":"My dad is 77 and I'm 22.

Jujitsu isn't all about trying to submit your opponent, body control comes first. Learning how to move another person efficiently is the first thing you learn, and something like that translates VERY well in bed. If you want to move into a different position, you don't say \"hey, lets try doggy style\" You just transition right into it. For instance let's say she is in cowgirl, and you want to pound her from behind. Instead of saying so, just grab hold of her hips, push a knee out from under her and buck sideways into to her guard, then put the back of your forearm under one of her legs, bring it across your body forcefully so she gets the message and turns her shoulders to match the motion, Lift her hips with your hands and push her ass forward with your own hips so that her knees get some traction and can hold her ass in the upward position. Boom, doggystyle. You have the ability to do things like that without saying a word, and women love it. You aren't just a a dick with a face in the sack anymore. You become an imposing force, that does whatever he wants because he can. Sex isn't just about one spot, it is about the whole body, and not enough people know how to really speak to that side of others. Anyone who goes into sex with you after the first time knows that any part of their body can and will be used if you decide so, and they like that.\nPlus every now and then you find a girl who just likes it when you pin her down so that she can't move (actually more often than not) while you still have a limb or two free. I can completely immobilize any girl with my legs and left arm alone. Leaving my right arm free to mess around with them any way I want. This is fun for a number of reasons. But essentially what you can do is turn your body into a bondage device.

Anyone who goes into sex with you after the first time knows that any part of their body can and will be used if you decide so, and they like that.\nPlus every now and then you find a girl who just likes it when you pin her down so that she can\u0026amp;#39;t move (actually more often than not) while you still have a limb or two free. I can completely immobilize any girl with my legs and left arm alone. Leaving my right arm free to mess around with them any way I want. This is fun for a number of reasons. But essentially what you can do is turn your body into a bondage device. I\u0026amp;#39;ve been practicing this technique since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer\u0026amp;#39;s table.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t1_dg5jt5q","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5pj26","UpVotes":121,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491993488,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"bms111","Body":"You are a sick human being.","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You are a sick human being.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t1_dg5pj26","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5pq5w","UpVotes":64,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491994044,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]}]},{"Author":"Kraile","Body":"I had to double-check I wasn't in /r/restofthefuckingowl","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I had to double-check I wasn\u0026amp;#39;t in \u0026lt;a href=\"/r/restofthefuckingowl\"\u0026gt;/r/restofthefuckingowl\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t1_dg5it26","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5nkrn","UpVotes":92,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491987434,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"Byrgenwerth_Dropout","Body":"First thing i thought of.\n\nYeah, let me just lift up the attacker with my legs and rotate him 180 degrees while simultaneously applying an arm bar before he even hits the ground.","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;First thing i thought of.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yeah, let me just lift up the attacker with my legs and rotate him 180 degrees while simultaneously applying an arm bar before he even hits the ground.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t1_dg5nkrn","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5rfwp","UpVotes":24,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491998127,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]},{"Author":"NapClub","Body":"yes, excellent technique, or if you have a change of heart you could always just put them out, tuck them in and get off the plane. \nprobably safer than flying united. \n\n\"United Airways, we put the hospital in hospitality!\"","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;yes, excellent technique, or if you have a change of heart you could always just put them out, tuck them in and get off the plane. \nprobably safer than flying united. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;United Airways, we put the hospital in hospitality!\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t1_dg5it26","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5myqz","UpVotes":65,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491985511,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"alexvenegas","Body":"Heel hook*","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Heel hook*\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t1_dg5it26","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5n0jw","UpVotes":19,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491985665,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]},{"Author":"ObviouslyVince","Body":"Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq3OjQexeUA","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Source: \u0026lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq3OjQexeUA\"\u0026gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq3OjQexeUA\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"videos","LinkID":"t3_64vz8b","ParentID":"t3_64vz8b","SubredditID":"t5_2qh1e","FullID":"t1_dg5jf3u","UpVotes":2630,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1491976125,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"reddit111987","Body":"Yeah, OP stole the video with his Streamable link.
