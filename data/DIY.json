Maybe they were in the midst of eviction proceedings and were pissed off?  Anyway holy *shit* would some of those units be downright fucked by the time we were sent in to clear it out.  I mean they'd literally shit in the sinks and whatnot, unplug the fridge and leave the doors open so it would fester...man did I earn my pay on those days.\n\nThe worst, the absolute worst, wasn't even an eviction but a woman who called up and said her refrigerator was broken.  So we go out and apparently the fridge had been leaking for like fucking ever and had rotted completely through the floor and actually fell through the floor into the crawlspace under the building.  There were like millions of roaches everywhere (think *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom*, it was *that* bad) and this woman just sat there in her living room while we were working watching TV while roaches were crawling on her and everywhere like it was no big deal...she would just flick them off of her and continue on watching her program.  Meanwhile there was half a dozen of us maintenance men, even the owner who never did a goddamn thing resembling manual labor, having to heft this fridge up and out of the floor so it could be pulled out and the floor could be fixed.

So we go out and apparently the fridge had been leaking for like fucking ever and had rotted completely through the floor and actually fell through the floor into the crawlspace under the building.  There were like millions of roaches everywhere (think \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, it was \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; bad) and this woman just sat there in her living room while we were working watching TV while roaches were crawling on her and everywhere like it was no big deal...she would just flick them off of her and continue on watching her program.  Meanwhile there was half a dozen of us maintenance men, even the owner who never did a goddamn thing resembling manual labor, having to heft this fridge up and out of the floor so it could be pulled out and the floor could be fixed.

If, in that glass house, you add typical insulation to every surface except the floor, you would see light flooding out of the house through the floor.  So, you insulate the floor, too.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"DIY","LinkID":"t3_5xu96h","ParentID":"t1_del8fzk","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7d","FullID":"t1_del9x3s","UpVotes":8,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1488835516,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null}]},{"Author":"superherofive","Body":"This is nicer and larger than anything I'll ever be able to afford as permanent living.","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is nicer and larger than anything I\u0026amp;#39;ll ever be able to afford as permanent living.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"DIY","LinkID":"t3_5xu96h","ParentID":"t3_5xu96h","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7d","FullID":"t1_dekynuk","UpVotes":22,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1488822687,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"GamingWithBilly","Body":"They call these Non-Agricultural Barns in Oregon.

Just something to think about if you have to open it up again.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Edit: Few guys here pointing out my plastic washer idea wouldn\u0026amp;#39;t work very well, due to either them being too brittle and also not conductive, which would make the batteries not work. Which is bad. New ideas are a layer of conductive grease in between the nut and bus bar, which would prevent dissimilar metal contact, as would changing the materials involved. Covering the nut in PRC sealant to exclude water would also stop the corrosion.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026amp;#39;m pretty stoked my highest rated comment is about corrosion.

Zalucki Department of Entomology, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4067 (Australia)\n\n\n\"Observation of the behavior of insects which have recently suffered a variety of injuries provides more direct evidence bearing on the question. No example is known to us of an insect showing protective behavior towards injured body parts, such as by limping after leg injury or declining to feed or mate because of general abdominal injuries. On the contrary, our experience has been that insects will continue with normal activities even after severe injury or removal of body parts. An insect walking with a crushed tarsus, for example, will continue applying it to the substrate with undiminished force. Among our other observations are those on a locust which continued to feed whilst itself being eaten by a mantis; aphids continuing to feed whilst being eaten by coccinellids; a tsetse fly which flew in to feed although halfdissected; caterpillars which continue to feed whilst tachinid larvae bore into them; many insects which go about their normal life whilst being eaten by large internal parasitoids; and male mantids which continue to mate as they are eaten by their partners. Insects show no immobilisation equivalent to the mammalian reaction to painful body damage, nor have our preliminary observations of the response of locusts to bee stings revealed anything analogous to a mammalian response. Wigglesworth 24 has provided additional examples of insect non-response to treatment which would certainly produce both pain and violent reactions in humans. Whilst these examples do not prove that insects do not suffer pain, they strongly suggest that if a pain sense is present it is not having any adaptive influence on the behavior, such as causing a damaged part to be protected until healed.

No example is known to us of an insect showing protective behavior towards injured body parts, such as by limping after leg injury or declining to feed or mate because of general abdominal injuries. On the contrary, our experience has been that insects will continue with normal activities even after severe injury or removal of body parts. An insect walking with a crushed tarsus, for example, will continue applying it to the substrate with undiminished force.

Now, comments:\n\nMany installers repeatedly call out conduits that are too small in diameter for the reality of data wire pulling. More dangerously, installation designs that are reviewed by engineers who haven't pulled cable themselves can get \"value engineered,\" meaning they say \"nobody needs 1 ½\" conduit for data!\" and they screw up the installation. When this happens, it is discovered after the electrician runs the conduit, when the low voltage installer comes to run cable, at which time it is too late to avoid expensive changes.\n\nFor the runs into the living room from the basement, I'd consider drilling down instead of drilling up. That way your holes start exactly where you want them in the living room, and coming out where they must in the basement. This is more forgiving than going the other way.\n\nBIG DEAL: The keystones are properly done with as little untwisted cable as possible. BIG DEAL, that! Untwisted wire lowers the speed at which data can be transferred.\n\nA OR B: The two wiring methods, 568A and 568B, do indeed offer no difference in performance. As noted, 568B has become the standard method to use. Don't ask why.\n\nAlso, be sure to look at the colors shown on the connector, especially if you have more than one model of connector in your installation. The wires don't always punch down in the same order from one connector model to the next.\n\nI don't understand why research was necessary to ensure that the keystones fit into the cover plates, but that's because I refuse to mix brands, and just for that reason!\n\nGREAT to cover the cables under the deck. You'd be surprised what critters will chew on.\n\nThat photo of the wire along the street reminds me of every installation I've ever done without enough boxes of wire. It is less expensive (in business, not in a home installation) to buy four boxes of 1000 feet each to do four runs of 250 feet because the cost of labor far exceeds the cost of wire.\n\nIn your conduit runs, I hope you removed the tape as you pulled the wires into the conduit. Slight differences in wire length caused by wires not lining up perfectly translates into a thicker bundle of wire, making fit worse.\n\nFreezer workbench: Some kind of desk or bench is absolutely necessary on a job like this. NEVER place a rack where it will be hidden away because you'll hardly ever need to access it, because you'll make the actual installation and any subsequent service a living hell. Be sure you adjust your workspace to your physical needs as much as possible when doing any job.\n\nFor reference, the \"plastic dividers\" inside the cables are called splines.\n\nWell, something is missing here: your photos make it look as though you magically punched down the wires with the jack panels in place, meaning you reached around to the backs of the panels and, sight unseen, made all punchdowns. How did you really to this? We remove the jack panels and turn them around. In this case, left stays on the left and we'd rotate up towards ourselves. With all the great detail you provide, it's disappointing that you left this out. You might have just done it without thinking to photograph it, though.\n\nMost professional installations bundle the cables laterally so that little depth is required for the cabling. This approach makes a lot more sense as the cables are visible and available for service. It's really difficult to service a tweaky jack connection if there are a dozen wires on top of the punchdown location!\n\nI'd test connections wire by wire, or perhaps room by room here, instead of waiting till all punchdowns were done. That way any errors are found when there are fewer wires to deal with, and if you've made a systematic mistake you'll have up to four wires to correct, instead of forty-seven, when you find the problem.\n\nYes, the custom length patch cables you want aren't worth the crimping work. More importantly, though, factory-made patch cables use stranded wire, so they are more flexible and forgiving than hand-made cables, unless you buy 1000 feet of stranded wire and get RJ45 plugs for stranded wire – yes, they're different!\n\nBefore you install any PoE equipment, plan out the space for the PoE injectors, unless you're using a PoE switch.\n\nI've been called on before to critique installations, and I see no mistakes or missteps here. What do you do for a living? It sure could be home audio/video and/or network installation! \n\nCongratulations on a job well done.","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Professional A/V installer here.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is an EXCELLENT installation.

Be sure you adjust your workspace to your physical needs as much as possible when doing any job.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For reference, the \u0026amp;quot;plastic dividers\u0026amp;quot; inside the cables are called splines.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, something is missing here: your photos make it look as though you magically punched down the wires with the jack panels in place, meaning you reached around to the backs of the panels and, sight unseen, made all punchdowns. How did you really to this? We remove the jack panels and turn them around. In this case, left stays on the left and we\u0026amp;#39;d rotate up towards ourselves. With all the great detail you provide, it\u0026amp;#39;s disappointing that you left this out. You might have just done it without thinking to photograph it, though.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Most professional installations bundle the cables laterally so that little depth is required for the cabling. This approach makes a lot more sense as the cables are visible and available for service. It\u0026amp;#39;s really difficult to service a tweaky jack connection if there are a dozen wires on top of the punchdown location!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026amp;#39;d test connections wire by wire, or perhaps room by room here, instead of waiting till all punchdowns were done. That way any errors are found when there are fewer wires to deal with, and if you\u0026amp;#39;ve made a systematic mistake you\u0026amp;#39;ll have up to four wires to correct, instead of forty-seven, when you find the problem.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yes, the custom length patch cables you want aren\u0026amp;#39;t worth the crimping work. More importantly, though, factory-made patch cables use stranded wire, so they are more flexible and forgiving than hand-made cables, unless you buy 1000 feet of stranded wire and get RJ45 plugs for stranded wire – yes, they\u0026amp;#39;re different!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Before you install any PoE equipment, plan out the space for the PoE injectors, unless you\u0026amp;#39;re using a PoE switch.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026amp;#39;ve been called on before to critique installations, and I see no mistakes or missteps here. What do you do for a living? It sure could be home audio/video and/or network installation! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Congratulations on a job well done.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"DIY","LinkID":"t3_5zjhw0","ParentID":"t3_5zjhw0","SubredditID":"t5_2qh7d","FullID":"t1_deyxpy5","UpVotes":79,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1489602810,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"Theonlykd","Body":"Can someone ELI5 this?

It isn't a black art, fortunately! \n\nHere's some basic tips if you're a beginner.\n\n* Set the soldering iron temperature to about 20-30%!more than the melting temperature of the solder\n* Keep the tip tinned with solder at all times, even when in the stand or cooling. This will prolong tip life and stop the tip from oxidising\n* Remove oxidation using brass wool or tip cleaner\n* Use a very slightly damp sponge to remove excess solder from the tip\n* With the tip wet, apply the tip to both parts of the joint simultaneously (leg and solder pad in this case)\n* Feed the solder into the work, not the tip, in this case right where the leg protrudes from the circuit board\n* Aim to achieve a concave fillet of solder around the circumference of the leg, so it kind of looks like a volcano\n* If you have a wet tip (as it were) but are getting a brown/black build up around the pool of solder on the tip, the iron temperature is probably too high\n* Don't be tempted to rework joints unless they are making a poor mechanical connection. Cosmetic defects are undesirable but reheating a joint can cause all sorts of problems. If you do decide to reheat a joint, make sure you apply heat for long enough to melt the entire joint.

This will prolong tip life and stop the tip from oxidising\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Remove oxidation using brass wool or tip cleaner\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Use a very slightly damp sponge to remove excess solder from the tip\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;With the tip wet, apply the tip to both parts of the joint simultaneously (leg and solder pad in this case)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Feed the solder into the work, not the tip, in this case right where the leg protrudes from the circuit board\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Aim to achieve a concave fillet of solder around the circumference of the leg, so it kind of looks like a volcano\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If you have a wet tip (as it were) but are getting a brown/black build up around the pool of solder on the tip, the iron temperature is probably too high\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Don\u0026amp;#39;t be tempted to rework joints unless they are making a poor mechanical connection. Cosmetic defects are undesirable but reheating a joint can cause all sorts of problems. If you do decide to reheat a joint, make sure you apply heat for long enough to melt the entire joint.

It's a relatively cheap, fairly robust V8.\n\nA lot of the stuff here is well documented from years of tuners and builders dropping the 1UZFE into various cars from all makes and models. The Supra gearbox does *not* bolt directly to the 1UZFE. You need either a custom bell housing or an adapter plate to fit it on. Second, you need a clutch, flywheel, and throw bearing to fit this. \n\nAgain, all of this is well documented and there are entire kits to do all of this online. More adventurous/money saving individuals can piece together all the parts from scrap yards and national auto parts chains.\n\nSource: I looked into the 1UZFE for use as a race engine in an amateur racing series.\n\n**** **Edit**\n\nEnough people are asking for info that I feel obligated to info dump some forum posts and websites:\n\n* [Here is the best site I've found for detailed information on the 1UZFE.
