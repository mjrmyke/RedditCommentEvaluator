I was in a total panic and lit a cigarette while I contemplated what to do. A foolish 21 year old in a posh restaurant with no way of paying for an excellent meal serve to me by an excellent waiter with a beautiful date. There was no way I was going to dash on this.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I humbly accepted my fate and decided to get whatever money I could out of the ATM when the waiter walked out and asked me if everything was ok. I came clean, ready to relinquish myself to dishwashing duties or whatever punishment they could deal out. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;He said, \u0026amp;quot;You know, you\u0026amp;#39;re not the first person this has happened to. Just leave what you can and your contact information and pay us when you can. I\u0026amp;#39;ll tell your girlfriend there is a problem with the ATM\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I was floored. I felt like hugging him but he went inside before I could. I went to the ATM and it was a real sketchy one, but I didn\u0026amp;#39;t care. I put my card in and \u0026amp;quot;GOD DAMN!\u0026amp;quot; I had forgotten it was payday. I had more than enough to cover the bill in my account.   \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Not only did I pay that bill with pride, I bought 3 shots for me, my date and the waiter and left him a $100 tip.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Biggest roller coaster dinner I ever had.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"food","LinkID":"t3_401tz0","ParentID":"t1_cyqwa7u","SubredditID":"t5_2qh55","FullID":"t1_cyr5k2o","UpVotes":111,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1452291892,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"PhanDuel","Body":"What do you do at 21 to warrant a $700 date being acceptable? special occasion?

My experience with the locals, so far, has been lovely. They\u0026amp;#39;re so respectful and kind. Everyone is so helpful. Even if someone doesn\u0026amp;#39;t speak English, we can somehow still manage to respectfully communicate our needs. All this to say, you know what hits me hard, now? When I watch videos of Americans in America, screaming at people who were speaking something other than English, that, \u0026amp;quot;This is America! Speak fucking English!\u0026amp;quot; I find it even more disgusting than I did before. I don\u0026amp;#39;t think a Japanese person would ever dream of screaming, \u0026amp;quot;This is Japan, speak fucking Japanese!\u0026amp;quot; It\u0026amp;#39;s just so unnecessary, rude and disrespectful.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I almost don\u0026amp;#39;t want to go back to America, honestly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"food","LinkID":"t3_5ufguh","ParentID":"t1_ddtx7pd","SubredditID":"t5_2qh55","FullID":"t1_ddudooc","UpVotes":30,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1487291503,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":null},{"Author":"Stephennim","Body":"Same here!
