Maybe the computer prepares some frames in advance, or then falls behind on half the screen or on every other column. It's basically impossible to run smoothly at exactly 60Hz. It's smooth, but there's subtle stutter you can just barely notice. However your recording, depending on software and settings, might have recorded a full frame 60 times a second. Then it plays back at exactly 60fps on a 60Hz screen and it appears beautifully smooth. Even this 60fps gfy looks nicer to me than a game at 100fps on a 144Hz monitor in some regards due to the lack of subtle staggering between rendered frames.\n\nOptions to try and get this smooth while playing (in order of increasing expensiveness): \n\n- Vsync. This is found in the game and graphics card settings. If you can get more frames per second out of your machine than your monitor displays, you can set Vsync to try and set up a complete frame at a time before they show on the screen in full and in sync with the screen refresh (triple buffering is another setting on top of this that can make the picture and frame rate even more consistent). If your computer isn't powerful enough though this could lead to input lag between when you do something and when it shows on screen. Or it could drop down to a lower manageable refresh rate like 30fps which is often less desirable then a stuttering 60 or above.\n\n- Gsync/freesync. With a compatible screen and graphics card, instead of Vsync trying to organize the frames to match the monitor, the monitor will listen to the graphics card and refresh itself at whatever variable rates the card is putting out. This eliminates input lag and stutter/tearing of the picture. Basically the smoothness will be directly related to how smooth your machine can render instead of trying to meet tough criteria to match a monitor that's flashing exactly 60 times a second at your eyes. Many modern cards can handle this, but the compatible monitors often come at a premium.\n\n- Ridiculously high refresh rate monitor and ridiculously high frame per second game rendering. If you buy a 144Hz monitor and you tweak your PC hardware / settings to the point that it's outputting more than 144 frames per second at all times, you can forget all the above options. The desync between rendering and screen still exists, but in such small time intervals that you probably can't perceive it, and all you perceive is butter smooth, fast response gameplay. You can still add on gsync or vsync but they're not likely to add anything noticeable. Depending on the game this option doesn't have to break the bank. If you have a 144Hz monitor but your computer is a bit older compared to newer games, you can lower graphics settings like resolution, anti-aliasing, shadow quality, etc. until your frames per second might be able to reach 144 or above. Some people play games competitively like this. It gives them the smoothest play they can afford, and low graphics settings sometimes helps enemy players show up better than if they were obscured by fancy textures and shadows.\n\nEdit: Resolution plays a big factor in achievable frame rates. 4k gaming is doing at least 4 times the work per frame that 1080p is. Unless you're filthy rich, and even then may not quite achieve this, there's usually a compromise between high frame rate gaming and high resolution gaming. Some people go all in on one or the other. Some go half and half gaming at 1440p and hitting 100fps with freesync/gysync on their favorite new game. If you have a monster PC that eats 144Hz monitors for breakfast, don't worry about buying a Gsync screen. The only time 144Hz + Gsync might be a good buy is if you won't write be reaching 144 in game, but you'll be between 60 and 144.","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many 60fps videos look smoother than 60fps gameplay.
