I started at one end of the mall and I started hitting those little ramps. I made four or five of them before I heard this beeping noise. Right behind me is a mall cop on a Segway! He\u0026amp;#39;s flashing white and blue and visibly freaking out: \u0026amp;quot;What in the hell in going on here?! What are those?!\u0026amp;quot; And I reply \u0026amp;quot;Kid\u0026amp;#39;s shoes with wheels in them.\u0026amp;quot; And he says \u0026amp;quot;That\u0026amp;#39;s really neat and all but I can\u0026amp;#39;t have you flying around in here like that!\u0026amp;quot; I laughed really hard, my husband, just now catching up to me, laughs really hard. Just behind mall cop is an exit. I wheel over to the exit and leave.  Cop sputtering the whole time...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I was stopped for speeding by a mall cop on a Segway. Good times! \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;","Subreddit":"funny","LinkID":"t3_54qjsr","ParentID":"t1_d846592","SubredditID":"t5_2qh33","FullID":"t1_d846wco","UpVotes":187,"DownVotes":0,"Created":1474989958,"Edited":false,"BannedBy":null,"ApprovedBy":null,"AuthorFlairTxt":null,"AuthorFlairCSSClass":null,"NumReports":null,"Likes":null,"Replies":[{"Author":"Captive_Hesitation","Body":"Oh.

He said \"I didn't know you ride a bike.\" He said \"Do you know what we call bike riders at the Trauma Department of the Roosevelt Hospital?\" I said \"No.\" He said \"Donors.\"\n\n\nThat was one thing and literally two days later, a friend of mine was talking about an Aunt who was at Moorfields Eye Hospital and she was going to have a cataract operation or a corneal graft. The chap came in - the consultant. He said \"Now Mrs Alton. I'm sure you've heard about it. We are going to cut out that nasty old lens, that cloudy old lens and we are going to sew in a nice bright fresh new one. It's a very simple operation and it only takes a few hours and you will be out and seeing wonderfully.
