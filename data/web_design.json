Ha ha ha, no I\u0026amp;#39;m just kidding, they tied the whole industry up in regressive legal bullshit and refused to accept that printing in magazines was no longer the way of the future.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Fonts have only become viable and reasonable thanks to the influence of big players like Google Font and TypeKit, both of which make font usage reasonable, affordable, and relatively simple.

It is incredibly hard to make a good font. \n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nMost fonts take several years to develop. (Here’s an [excellent post about the development of Balto](https://typesupply.com/news/2013/9/the-development-of-balto) which took six years to make). Six years is probably a long time to work on a font. A year or two is probably considered a normal timeframe for drawing a font.\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nA good font is well drawn, meaning that points are placed in proper places on the outline. (Bad outlines can cause strange artifacts when rendered.) Every letter has to work with every other letter in the font both in terms of size and contrast. Modern fonts are contain anywhere from 300 glyphs for a basic Latin 1 font to 1000s of glyphs for Latin, Central European, Greek and Cyrillic. All those glyphs have to be drawn and proofed. (Side note: designer proofs are crazy. Reams of paper with strange text in various sizes). \n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOnce the font has been drawn, it needs to be kerned. This is where letters are fit together for proper spacing and word flow. Essentially you need to put each letter into a string of letters and adjust how they sit together. Modern kerning (class kerning) easily runs into the thousands of pairs. \nThis is where you can easily separate a good font from a bad font. Bad fonts rarely include kerning.

It is incredibly hard to make a good font. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Most fonts take several years to develop. (Here’s an \u0026lt;a href=\"https://typesupply.com/news/2013/9/the-development-of-balto\"\u0026gt;excellent post about the development of Balto\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; which took six years to make). Six years is probably a long time to work on a font. A year or two is probably considered a normal timeframe for drawing a font.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A good font is well drawn, meaning that points are placed in proper places on the outline. (Bad outlines can cause strange artifacts when rendered.) Every letter has to work with every other letter in the font both in terms of size and contrast. Modern fonts are contain anywhere from 300 glyphs for a basic Latin 1 font to 1000s of glyphs for Latin, Central European, Greek and Cyrillic. All those glyphs have to be drawn and proofed. (Side note: designer proofs are crazy. Reams of paper with strange text in various sizes). \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Once the font has been drawn, it needs to be kerned. This is where letters are fit together for proper spacing and word flow. Essentially you need to put each letter into a string of letters and adjust how they sit together. Modern kerning (class kerning) easily runs into the thousands of pairs. \nThis is where you can easily separate a good font from a bad font. Bad fonts rarely include kerning. Or they only include it for the really bad pairs (VA, Te, LT, etc). Someone who is fast at kerning can do one font in an afternoon; a family would take a week of mind-numbing work. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Finally, web fonts need to be hinted.

All these Fonts can be used with only minimum restriction. Most of them use the SIL Open Font License, that grants you nearly endless freedom in usage. The only restriction they make are pretty common sense as: Do not sell it to others, etc. So a very sane.

And that was because the Artist did such a great job and should be compansated for that work. The bad thing is: He gave his font into a portfolio of a commercial vendor. This vendor that applies all his marketing ideas to it and slices it in packages, gives you comba-deals and volume-discounts and has special offers and also applies all his restrictions from his licence catalog to it. That said, it is now super hard to know when you crossed the legal line or not. You cant use the Font for example in a T-Shirt-Making WebApp, as the User could use the font to create a 3rd Party product. You however can use the font as a Vector shape that can not be modified by the user.

Sorry, I'm going to be way too serious about what is supposed to be a funny image.\n\nFirst of, the conclusions that are drawn based on the clients feedback are likely not accurate for a large amount of clients and condensing them to these types of recommendations is rather simplistic.\n\nFor instance, the term **\"Luxury\"** may mean something entirely different for a company like Rolex vs a company like BMW. For Rolex, luxury may describe of feeling of owning something age old and intentional or hand crafted, while for BMW it could mean spacious, or powerful. What's the feeling when you get into a BMW? How do we translate that feeling into design and brand messaging?\n\nWhile people love griping on the term **\"Make it Pop\"** there can be something clearly learned from the comment. One component on the page has less contrast from the other components than the client wants. Why does the client want this component to stand out? Is their purpose valid? How can we implement their change while staying true to the brand concepts we've established?\n\n**\"The logo looks like a font\"** - Adding a shape to a client's brand because they've seen it on trendy logos is a pretty bad approach. What does having a mark mean to your brand? I would want to explain how our design translates positively to a lot of different mediums, and how we need to be intentional and careful if we're bringing a geometric shape into our design. Does the shape just follow hip trends or can this mark be used in multiple applications for a very long period of time? What shapes or symbols make sense if any?\n\n**\"I'll know what I want when I see it.\"** - We need to a design solution that meets your needs and budget. This requires us to understand your company, brand and audience.\n\nWe simply can't give recommendations without having understanding the client's direction. \n\n**It needs to look friendlier** - I recently worked on an sex application (that's all I really want to say) that was geared towards being friendly and playful. The context of the word friendly is key, and we need to understand why the client has an affinity for that word. I would probably give them some moodboards or do additional design discovery in this instance to try and suss out their interpretation of this in the context of their brand and goals for their application.\n\n**\"Make it look like Apple\"** - Yes! We love Apple here. What about Apple specifically do you feel would speak to your audience? Is it their design, their messaging, their voice, their products? \n\nMake it look like \"X\" is a great design insight and it can be very useful in helping establish a direction for the company. If they like thin fonts, or a lot of white space, or their brand voice, we can play off of that without plagiarizing. Apple has their own thing, and if a company is enamored with Apple's vision, perhaps some of the paths that Apple took in design may make sense for their company as well. Finding their own unique voice within or around that is the key.\n\n**\"Can it be more retro?\"** - Of course it can. I'd want to make sure a retro feel would be applicable for their brand.  What about retro specifically appeals to the client? Maybe they like the idea of conveying that they've been doing business for 60 years and they want to pay homage to that somehow in the design. Retro is even so broad that we would need to define it more. Is it a retro style like Art Deco that you would see in an old building, or is it the American retro design we saw in the 40s \u0026amp; 50s, or is it more like the German Bauhaus styling? Sure we could jump to the conclusion that it's the hipster style and that's what's on every website, but those trends are the web 2.0 of 2010. As designers we need to always be asking about why we are putting a shape here. Why are these buttons rounded? Why did we choose that color? How do these decisions align with the client's vision? Are they there simply for aesthetics? Is the trade off of giving more aesthetic complexity worth complicating the design or messaging?\n\n**\"Make it look Classy\"** - Same as all the others above. Hurr durr.. trajan is a \"Classy\" font. Let's use it on every website that needs to look classy. Trajan is a well drawn font, but at this point, it's too over saturated. I think we can do better. There are a lot of fonts and font combinations out there.\n\nOkay, all that ranting aside. Some clients do think this way, and they don't give a damn about design research, and they may be expecting the answers provided in this image. They want it their way. They know what they like. I'd recommend every designer spends more time in the earlier phases of their projects researching and validating an aesthetic direction with their client before jumping into design concepting. If you get a job and the first thing you do is design a concept, well of course these are the comments you're going to get back. You just took whatever shit trends you have in your back pocket and made a website that has no soul or connection to the clients brand or company. It's your word versus theirs, and they don't have a reason to view you as a professional at all at this point. (Hint: if that's the case, they probably aren't worth having as a client.) I've had clients question my education, throw away complete design research surveys from 100s of users, design over my shoulder... fuck 'em. Really. There are good clients out there that enjoy thought and care behind design... Immensely.

Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\\\\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.

The jokes are usually told in broken English, without [articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar\\)), in the way that a native Russian speaker might, which makes such reversals easier. A Russian reversal is an example of both an [antimetabole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimetabole) and a [transpositional pun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpositional_pun).\n\n\u0026gt;Examples include:\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), you catch a cold.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In Soviet Russia, cold catches you!\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In America, people start fires.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In Soviet Russia, fire starts you!\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In America, you break law.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In Soviet Russia, law breaks you!\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In America, your work determines your marks.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In Soviet Russia, [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) determines your work!\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In America, [you assassinate presidents.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy)\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In Soviet Russia, [presidents assassinate you!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance)\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In America, you watch *[Big Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(TV_series\\))*.\n\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;In Soviet Russia, [Big Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Big_Brother) watches you!\n\n\u0026gt;This type of joke has existed since at least the 1960s. In the 1968–1973 television show *[Laugh-In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh-In)*, a recurring character, \"Piotr Rosmenko the Eastern European Man\" (played by [Arte Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arte_Johnson)), delivered short jokes such as \"Here in America, is very good, everyone watch television. In old country, television watches you!\" This joke alludes to video screens that both [reproduce images and monitor the citizenry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescreen), as in *[Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)*.\n\n\u0026gt;The joke form is often credited to Ukrainian-American comedian [Yakov Smirnoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Smirnoff), although he only rarely used Russian reversals. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Much of his material, especially during the peak of his popularity in the mid-1980s, did involve comparisons between life in the United States and in the Soviet Union, but he did not often use that particular form of wordplay. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] One exception was a [Miller Lite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Lite) commercial he appeared in in 1985, in which he states, \"In America, there's plenty of light beer and you can always find a party. In Russia, [Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) always finds you.\" \n\n\u0026gt;Later parodies of Smirnoff's act on various television shows did include Russian reversals:\n\n\u0026gt;\n\n\n\u0026gt;* In a 2001 episode of *[Family Guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy)*, \"[There's Something About Paulie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%!s_Something_About_Paulie)\", a car navigation system has a \"Yakov Smirnoff\" setting, in which it intersperses directions (in a Russian accent) with jokes such as \"In Soviet Russia, car drives you!\" (This may have been the first instance of such a joke with the exact \"In Soviet Russia\" phrasing.)\n\n\u0026gt;* In a 2002 episode of *[The Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons)*, \"[The Old Man and the Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Key)\", as part of his comedy revue, Smirnoff (voiced by an actor) states \"In Soviet Russia, review watches you!\"\n\n\u0026gt;* In a 2002 episode of *[Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama)*, \"[Crimes of the Hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_of_the_Hot)\", [Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry_(Futurama\\)) states, \"That ice dispenser is so big, the ice crushes you!

I'll probably \"fail horribly\" at your test, but to me, there is no universal answers to such questions. Your opinion is yours, and if the opinion of people you challenge differs from yours, it doesn't absolutely mean they are wrong.\n\nMy opinion on Comic Sans :\n\n- It is way too fucking overused. Simply because it's one of the basic fonts you get with any computer (correct me if I'm wrong, I never used Mac OS nor Linux though). Anybody can use it, it's free. It's a good thing it's free though. I can't recall of any of my MSN Messenger contact not using bold comic sans.\n\n- Most people using it in a professionnal way are self designed \"brand\" (most of the time those are tiny, family ones, etc.. Atleast in my experience). I can't think of any situation where comic sans fits, and with time, it took a \"funny\" almost stupid connotation. Without even talking about design world, where it's kind of an agreed upon convention that comic sans is part of the fonts you don't wanna use.\n\n- People don't take seriously brands (I'm not talking tiny ones) whose logo is made with comic sans. Or atleast they don't take them as seriously as they take another brand. Most people *know* comic sans, and seeing it on a logo, I'm pretty sure, makes them think about how unoriginal the designer was.\n\nIt's all about communication, and what are the instant reactions.
