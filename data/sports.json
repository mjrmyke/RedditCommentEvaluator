One is what you said, and the other is people immediately becoming defensive and jumping to the extreme end of the argument. For example:\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\nPerson A: I do not find this joke funny, it\u0026amp;#39;s offensive\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\nPerson B: Are you saying we should outlaw jokes now????\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And then person B gets upvoted because they\u0026amp;#39;re \u0026amp;quot;defending\u0026amp;quot; humor or whatever, but it really ends up being validation so people who are reading don\u0026amp;#39;t have to feel bad about themselves the next time they make a joke that can be perceived as offensive.

","BodyHTML":"\u0026lt;div class=\"md\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To be more specific, there are always ground rules for the ball leaving the playing field or striking various parts of the playing field or stadium. There are league-wide ground rules covering most weird interactions, as you can see on the Yankee\u0026amp;#39;s ground rule page for Yankee Stadium \u0026lt;a href=\"http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/information/index.jsp?content=ground_rules\"\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As seen at the bottom of that link, ground rules can also be specific to the ballpark.

Even a \u0026amp;quot;normal\u0026amp;quot; field can have complex ground rules - see the rules for Target Field \u0026lt;a href=\"http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/ballpark/information/index.jsp?content=ground_rules\"\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For the Metrodome, which was very similar to the Tokyo Dome, a ball that got caught in the roof over fair territory resulted in the player getting two bases.
